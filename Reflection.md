Reflection

Creating my first Django project was both challenging and rewarding. At first, the process felt very confusing, even though there were guides to follow. Downloading Django was actually the easiest step, but when it came to creating the code, running commands in PowerShell, and connecting the project to GitHub, I often got lost. The most difficult part was dealing with errors in the command prompt, since some commands did not work as expected. At first, I felt frustrated because I thought I had reached my limit.

However, I learned to carefully read the errors and search for solutions, which helped me slowly understand what went wrong and how to fix it. I also realized that making mistakes was part of the learning process. What made the experience more enjoyable was doing the activity with friendsâ€”it became a bonding moment where we helped each other solve problems. In the end, the project taught me patience, persistence, and teamwork. Setting up the environment, checking the Python and Django versions, activating the virtual environment, and pushing to GitHub gave me a deeper appreciation of the development workflow. Overall, it was confusing but fun, and I felt proud after completing it.Even though it was fresh start in this subject.
